# Crypto-market-analysis
Crypto market analysis and price prediction using deep learning in Python involve utilizing models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks), or GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) to capture temporal dependencies in price data. These models can predict future prices based on historical trends by analyzing features such as closing price, trading volume, and market sentiment. Libraries like TensorFlow and Keras are commonly used for building and training these models. The key challenge lies in selecting the right architecture and hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
